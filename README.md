## What is this
Atomix-js is a Javascript re-write of and old favourite game of my childhood, **Atomix**. This version is written in ES2015 (aka Javascript ES6), ReactJS, Flow and Redux. Other libraries used are AphroditeCSS, redux-saga, Storybook, recompose and Lodash.

It's profit free, and meant to be only an experiment in certain libraries. All copyrights belong to the original creators of the game.

Author of the original game: Thalion Software and Softtouch (find out more about the original game at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomix_(video_game))
